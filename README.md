## About Me

I am a software developper, passionate about programming and AI, with a special interest in solving complex problems and getting exposed to new information and topics. I have a strong foundation in full-stack development, working with agile and fast-paced environments, and in initiating new projects. Those qualities and experiences have driven my curious jounrey through the world of software development, writing code in collaboration with others to build software that helps the world.

## Experience

### **Software Engineering Intern**  
**Obytes Technologies | May 2024 – Aug 2024**  
-  Migrated REST API suites from C#/.NET to Python/Django, optimizing time and memory complexity,
managing URL routing and up to five-tier nested serializers
- Developed unit tests for new features using pytest, Django factories, mock objects, and YAML fixtures,
validating functionality with database views and tables, edge cases, error handling, AWS S3 bucket
management, authorization, permissions, and curl commands.
- Initiated and implemented a migration tool using Dockerfile, Makefile, and git hooks to streamline local
database container migrations within Docker multi-container app, improving developer efficiency
- Documented custom authorization/authentication processes and JSON Web Token (JWT) handling to enable
the team to begin implementation.

### **Software Engineering Intern**  
**Inmind.ai | Jun 2023 – Aug 2023**  
- Integrated a querying and filtering application into databases managed using PostgreSQL, by implementing a
suite of APIs using Python FASTAPI framework and ensured protection against SQL injection attacks.
- Built a proof-of-concept machine learning and computer vision binary image classification model for
detecting bees and ants, using a pre-trained ResNet18 with data-augmentation in PyTorch. - [**_Source Code_**](https://github.com/Nicolas-Saade/PyTorch-DeepLearning-ImageClassification)
- Implemented principal component analysis (PCA), reducing dataset dimensionality for easier handling and
training of Support Vector Machines (SVM), with feature extraction algorithms (HOG, Word2vec, Tf-Idf),
built using scikit-learn, PyTorch and pandas.

### **Team Member**  
**McGill Robotics | Sep 2022 – Jan 2023**  
- Researched PID controls to address excessive strain on components caused by abrupt movements. Collaborated
with a team of engineers to modelize the rover’s control mechanism and feedback loop, enabling a better
understanding of rover positioning
